A Web Application: It's software that runs in your web browser (or as a dedicated mobile app) and allows you to interact with the vast database of Wikipedia articles.

Gateway to Knowledge: Its primary purpose is to help users find relevant articles on virtually any topic imaginable, from historical events and scientific concepts to biographies and cultural phenomena.

User-Friendly Interface: The core of the application is a simple search bar, typically located prominently on the page (or within your browser's search capabilities), where users can type their queries.

Free and Open: Wikipedia and its search functionality are completely free to use, supported by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, and entirely ad-free. The content itself is freely licensed, and the app code is open source.
